Find way to normalize data by relationship of distance, time, speed, hearrate, and elevation. 
apply weights depending on what influences the most. 

Use different trend and curve analysis to compare y values( date/time, date/distance, date/heartrate, etc)
take those equations to compare and generate useable relationships between data.

Add a gui, with buttons to swap between different graphs

store the data, and equations in a database, and use for training predictive models

add workout reccomendations to improve at the fastest pace, after the above.
# 🏃 RunAnalyzer — Dev Notes & Roadmap

## ✅ Completed
- Segment-based trend plotting
- Curve fit equation annotations
- Weekly data normalization
- High-contrast pastel theme

## 📌 Current To-Do
- [ ] Add `effort_index`, `cardiac_efficiency` to metrics
- [ ] Weight trend lines by slope or run distance
- [ ] GUI toggle for segmented trends
- [ ] Export weekly summary as PDF
- [ ] Streamlit dashboard prototype

## 🧠 Ideas
- Compare slope of HR trend vs pace trend
- Highlight segments with max/min trend slope
- Model fatigue curve over 7/28/56 day rolling windows
